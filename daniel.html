      <article>
        <p>I wrote my first website somewhere around 1996. At the time I didn't realise that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> was only 3 years old. I don't think I had even heard of <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a>.</p>
        <p>My Dad had bought a modem a few years earlier, and I was fascinated by being 'online'. Back then we called it surfing. We were surfing the internet using a modem that dialled our local <abbr title="Point of Presence">PoP</abbr> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompuServe">CompuServe</a>. I loved the rattle as we dialled up, the pings and screeches as our device negotiated a connection to the world wide web.</p>
        <p>The web felt more free then than it does today. Anyone could, and often did, build a website. Your ISP would give you a small amount of web space, or you could sign up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities">Geocities</a> and upload your website there. Animated gifs were not for messaging but for your website. We could use &lt;blink&gt; and &lt;marquee&gt; with free abandon. You learnt HTML by viewing other people's source and copy/pasting anything interesting.</p>
        <p>I have some of my original files. The datestamp on this gif is 1997 but it could well have been created earlier.<p>

        <p>Thank you Harriet for creating this <a href="https://github.com/Harriethw/html-day-bristol">repo</a> and letting people contribute for HTML day in Bristol.</p>
        <p>I still struggle with how to spell colour, centre, and grey.</p>
