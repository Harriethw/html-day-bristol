              <p>I have walked to build this website: my shirt rumpling up beneath the backpack slung across my shoulders, where my laptop is safely lodged, waiting for its time. I squinted in the sunlight, double-checked where I was going, and I arrived. I arrived, and I am here, and I am sending it to you.</p>

              <p>"You've gotten it all over your strap, all over your arm, all over your toes."</p>
              <p>The constant kick-snare beat of somebody's Bluetooth speaker.</p>
              <p>"HAYFEVER."</p>
              <p>"Don't chase the pigeon. Don't chase it, you'll fall!"</p>
              <p>The chattering call of seagulls.</p>
              <p>"OH MY GOD. OH MY GOD."</p>
              <p>A motor's distant roar.</p>
              <p>"I think it's near the shopping centre."</p>
